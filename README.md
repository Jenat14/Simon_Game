# Simon Game
A fun and interactive Simon Game developed to practice JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and sound incorporation. The game challenges users to remember and replicate a sequence of colors and sounds that increases in length with each level.

## Features
* Color and Sound Sequences: Generates a new color in the sequence each level, accompanied by corresponding sounds.
* Interactive User Input: Allows users to click color buttons or press specific keys to replicate sequences.
* Responsive Feedback: Visual feedback (button animations) and audio feedback for correct/incorrect sequences.
* Game Over & Restart Functionality: Provides immediate feedback when an incorrect button is pressed, ending the game and allowing a restart.
## How to Play
* Start the Game: Press any key to begin.
* Memorize the Sequence: Watch the color sequence that lights up, then repeat it by pressing the same buttons in the same order.
* Increase Levels: The game gets progressively harder as the sequence grows with each level.
* Game Over: If the wrong button is pressed, the game ends. Press any key to start over.
## Code Structure
* HTML: Provides the game structure and interface.
* CSS: Adds basic styling and animations for button clicks and game-over effects.
* JavaScript: Contains the game logic, including functions for sequence generation, user input handling, and feedback mechanisms.
